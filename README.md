 Number of Doors: Accepts any integer above 3
 The number of doors avaliable for the problem. The problem usually has 3 but I added the ability for more to expirement.

 This is where it doesn't ask you to pick a door and chooses one randomly, then chooses a different door on the next turn.

 This is the number times it will automatically run the problem and print the percentage it won at.
